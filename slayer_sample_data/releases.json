Penniless from their generosity, Sharing their money to quench your greed. Searching for the answer to their prayers They cry their last wish of need. Save me.  His spirit lives and breathes in me. The almighty transformed to your screen. The meanings lost in its translation, No holy words, describe his deception.  You say you'll help us find the lord, Tell me preacher how do you know A simple quest for a visible savior, To lead us through our final prayer. Save me.  Send your donations, Contribute to the cause. Luxuries, Your righteous reward?  Praise the lord, praise god, Is what you wish to sell. There is no heaven without a hell.  [LEAD: HANNEMAN]  In your mind's eye could you truly believe, That by giving you can save your soul, Could you be so naive! You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead, You blind the congregation With the things you say.  Religious blackmail a deceit of trust, That death will come and all will be lost.  Can you hear the serpents call, Look deep in those deceiving eyes. Ignore the writing on the wall, You should read between the lies.  When doubt subsides his honesty, An inquiry, is it blasphemy? Impure the soul, that's made to suffer, No sermons left to hide or cover, An empty promise, lie unfulfilled, To steal a dream or get it killed. They claim your trip to heavens nearby, You may believe it but satan wouldn't lie.",

This error was corrected on the Expanded Edition reissue CD.Three different versions of the outro to \"Raining Blood\" exist. On some LP versions, the sound of the storm is created by a looped groove which continues indefinitely until the stylus is lifted. On other LP versions, the storm just fades after about 15 seconds. On the CD and cassette version, the storm outro lasts for 50 seconds.The lyrics here are taken from the booklet of the expanded edition.Recording information:Recorded in L.A., mixed at New Fresh, N.Y.C.

Sewn together, joining heads Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart  Millions laid out in their crowded tombs Sickening ways to achieve the holocaust  Seas of blood, bury life Smell your death as it burns Deep inside of you Abacinate, eyes that bleed Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare Wings of pain, reach out for you His face of death staring down, Your blood running cold Injecting cells, dying eyes Feeding on the screams of the mutants he's creating  Pathetic harmless victims Left to die Rancid angel of death Flying free  (Leads: Hanneman, King, Hanneman,King, Hanneman)  Angel of death  Monarch to the kingdom of the dead Infamous butcher,  Angel of death  Angel of death",

Engreat souls condemned for eternity, Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.  Chaos rampant, An age of distrust. Confrontations. Impulsive sabbath.  On and on, south of heaven [x4]  [LEAD: KING]  The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul. A force that has lived all eternity. A never ending search for a truth never told. The loss of all hope and your dignity.  Chaos rampant, An age of distrust. Confrontations. Impulsive habitat.  On and on, south of heaven [x4]",

Emerging from their hellish tomb Taking flight amindst the night The evening skies are raining death  Swooping down from shadowed skies Taking simple human form Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man  Lock their jaws into your veins Satanic soldiers strike their prey Leaving corpses waiting for the change  Blood dripping from the jaws of death Not enough to satisfy They must drain your soul of life",
